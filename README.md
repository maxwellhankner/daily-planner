# Daily Planner

## Welcome to Maxwell Hankner's Daily Planner
Plan your day out and stay on track. You can also add this daily planner to another calendar so there is no hiding from your work!
## Features
This daily planner features an easy to read layout so anyone using it can stay focused on their work. A user can enter text in any one of the hour blocks and save their schedule. The data is persistant, so the user can close the tab and come back later. The current hour is also clearly displayed. Hours in the past, the present hour, and hours in the future are color coded so the user knows what time of day they are working in. Also, the user has the ability to add the daily plan to a calendar of their choice. That way, there is no escaping the tasks of the day.

## Challenges
The most challenging part of this project was adding the "add to calendar" feature. It uses a third-party script that I had to fully comprehend before I could start to work with it and manipulate it's functionality.

## Not-Included
If I had more time to work on this project, I would probably over-haul the interface. It's easy to use, as of now, but I would like to add my own feel to the project. I would also add a feature so the user could save previous days and plan out future days. At that point, it would be like any other fully functioning calendar app, but that would be a great way to work on my dev skills.

### Thanks for checking out this project!
